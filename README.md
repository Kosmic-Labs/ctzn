# CTZN

A distributed social network mad science experiment. WIP.

Twitter-style feed and posts. Users follow each other, post to their own p2p databases, and servers aggregate their community's data to provide large-scale indexes in their own p2p databases.

CTZN is a toolkit for political engineering. While it provides a core schema for social networks, it considers extensible PX to be a key design goal.
